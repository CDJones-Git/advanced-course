# Installing Python 

NOTE: Python may already be installed on your machine, as some new operating systems have it pre-installed. For this project you will be needing to use Python version 3.8 onwards. The below instructions are for version 3.9.


## Python Installation
0. Go to 'pyton.org/downloads/' and click on the 'Download Python 3.9.2'. (This may be different version based on when you open this document). This will download a file in your "Downloads" folder.
0. Double click on the file that was downloaded (it will have the "Python" and the version number in the filename) and click through the install instructions. NOTE: On Windows, you will need to select a box at the very beginning of the installation that reads "Add Python to your PATH".
0. Once the installation is done, you can close your install wizard, and also close down any terminals/command promt windows that you have open. 
0. Now open a terminal/command promt window and run the follow command 'python --version'. This should show the version you have just installed.


##Â PIP installation
0. First you will need to download a file called 'get-pip.py'. You can do that by either running the following command 'curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py' or downloading the file from here [Link](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py)
0. Once downloaded, open a terminal that is in the same location as the 'get-pip.py' file. From there you need to run the following command 'python get-pip.py'. NOTE: you will need to have installed Python before you do this step.
0. Once the installation is done, close down any terminals/command promt windows that you have open. 
0. Now open a terminal/command promt window and run the follow command 'pip --version'. This should show the version you have just installed.
