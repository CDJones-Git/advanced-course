# Installing IDE

An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is software that gives you the tools to build/write code and execute it. The IDE we suggest to use for this project is 'Visual Studio Code'.

## Install instructions
0. Go to [HERE](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and choose the operating system you are using.

## Using Visual Studio Code(VSCode) IDE
0. When you open VSCode, on the left is a banner with a files icon. When you click here it will show you the folder you are working from. If no folder is selected, you will need to click on the 'Open Folder' button and choose the folder with your project in it.
0. To run your files you can use the inbuilt terminal (works the same as a normal terminal) by going to 'Terminal' at the top banner and choosing 'New Terminal'
