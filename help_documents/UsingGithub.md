# Using Github
For this project we have put template code and example code in a github repository. You will need to download this code onto your machine and test that it runs. This document will show you how to use Github.

## How to get the code onto my machine?
### Method 1: Using terminal
- First you need to check if your machine has 'git' installed (you can do this from your terminal by running the 'git --version' command which should show you the version you have installed in your machine. If no version is shown then you need to download it)
- To download 'git' on Windows download the installer from this [LINK](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Follow the installer steps and once done you can test if 'git' is working on your machine by doing step 1 above.
- To download 'git' on Mac, download the installer from this [LINK](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/).  Follow the installer steps and once done you can test if 'git' is working on your machine by doing step 1 above.

### Method 2: Manual download of codebase
Note: this method will allow you to download the code but will mean if you want to pull down a latest version/add code to the repository/etc you will not be able to do so. For this course, you will most likely not be needing to do any of the previously mentioned so this is the suggested option.
0. Visit the github repository at this [LINK](https://github.com/raufabr/advanced-course)
0. On this page, there is a green button called 'Code' with a download icon. When you press this there will be a few options, but the one you want to press is 'Download ZIP'
0. Once downloaded you want to unzip the folder. This unzipped folder will have the code you need for the project. 


### Example code for all lesson
For each week have put example answers on branches in github. You can either pull down the branches using via termainl using the 'git checkout lesson1' command. This will only work if you have downloaded the project using Method 1 above.
If you have used Method 2 then you can still view the example code via the website. To see the code on branch, from the [main page](https://github.com/raufabr/advanced-course) click on the dropdown that says 'main'.
