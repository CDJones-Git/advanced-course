# Using Terminal/Command Promt
These two tools (Terminal/Command Prompt) are ways of using your machine via commands. You can use it to run your Python files.

- To run your file from terminal you will need to be in the folder where the file is. To move from one folder to another you use the 'cd' command. This command (short for 'Change Directory') will allow you to point your terminal to the right location. 
- Now to get the location of the file, you can either keep using 'cd myFolder' and move through your folders like that until you get to the one you want. Or you can 'Shift + rightclick' on a file and choose 'Copy as Path...' which will give you the file path. Then in your terminal start your command with 'cd' and paste the path you just copied. Before pressing enter, remove the speech marks and remove the file name at the end of the path. Then press enter and you will be in the right folder.
- To run your program (code that you have written in a Python file where the filename ends with .py), in your terminal you will need to run a command that starts with 'python' and then the name of your file. For example 'python myCode.py'.
